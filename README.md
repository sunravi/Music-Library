Music Library

This is a personal ms access project.
This has the following functions

1. Reads one or more folders recursively for music files
2. loads the file list into a table
3. calls a powershell script to get the music tags. This uses taglib# library
4. copies the files with music tag information to music library table

This can also udates the tags in the files from the music library table again calling a powershell script
